# My amazing-note-taker

## Example Usage
![](./not_so_amazing_sample.gif)

## Approach
As the front end was already created, I needed to look at connecting this to the backend. I broke down the problem into smaller objectives:
1. Start a server using Express
2. Link the HTML to get and post requests in the backend JavaScript
3. Write the user's notes to the server's JSON file with unique IDs
4. The post method needs to write the note to the JSON file for retrieval
5. The get method needs to retrieve notes from the server for viewing
6. The delete method needs to locate and delete specific notes from the server

## Challenges
* I didn't use Horuku as it has not been covered in the class and won't be until next week lesson.

* I have some difficulty with "Post" when I try to save my note. It showed 404 (not found) but when I looked at Headers in console, it showed the note in Form data tab. I wasn't able to crack it and tried both TA and BCS assistance. I would like to re-sumbit if that's ok as I felt my approach/pseudocode made sense. 

* understanding pathing with Express, creating unique ID according to its position, and deleting function with filter.
